*Builds event dictionaries for content_list from scraped events*
First Avenue's event calendar is formatted so the divs for each line of information
aren't unique, and the number of lines of information aren't uniform (some events have
two+ price points, have guest performers, are sold out, etc.)

Dictionary used for easier conversion to JSON
String keys for readability, sorting/queries
TODO: Figure out a way to cut down on elifs so this isn't so ugly/inefficient
